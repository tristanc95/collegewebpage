<p> Hello everyone! As stated previously, my name is Tristan Conde. I'm a Computer Information Systems graduate from Texas A&M University-Kingsville. I've been described as a hard working individual who has a love for technology and entertainment mediums, and can be a very nice guy. I am quite shy, though at first when it comes to meeting me, but once I get comfortable around people, I become open and friendly and fun to be around. </p>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style = "text-align: center"> Oh okay! Tell me more about yourself. </h1>
<img src= "meoutside.JPG" alt= "Picture of Me Outdoors" class = "aboutmepics" target = "_blank" style = "float: right">
<p> Ever since I was born, I've been raised and lived in Corpus Christi, TX; particularly in a little suburban area called Calallen. Located closer to Nueces County, Calallen is where I've spent 22 years of my life growing up and becoming who I am today. I graduated Calallen High School in 2014, 31st in my class and ended up going to TAMUK because of how close it was to family and the good prices it had to offer. There really isn't that much to do in Calallen so most of the time people will just take the 30 minute drive into Corpus Christi, or just hang around some parks or playgrounds that are around. It's a nice little town with really not a lot going on, but not enough to be considered a ghost town. </p>
<p> I now reside up in Fort Worth, TX and work at the UNT Health Science Center as a IT Specialist, but I'm always looking for new opportunities in not only the IT Tech field, but even some audio and video fields as well! I know I'm an IT guy by trade, but I've also been doing video and sound work for several years that you can read about <a href = "hobbies.html"> here </a> and <a href = "remixes.html"> here! </a>
<br>
<h1 style = "text-align: center"> How exciting! I need more.</h1>

<p> Throughout my time in high school, I was considered the computer guy around the time my senior year came around. In my high school, I helped setup and create my own high school technology course that was just considered an independent technology study. I took the class with one other student, a friend of mine, and we taught and learned programs such as Game Maker, Adobe Suite, etc. We also became the forefront for creating our school's current news team, and we also created a video for the high school that showcases the various business classes we had to offer that was shown as registrations and presentations for both current classmates and future ones. </p>
