<p> As stated in the about me part of the webpage, living in Calallen pretty much left me with some normal schooling for most of the way up. I attended elementary, intermediate, middle and high school all in Calallen and ended up graduating from there in 2014. It was actually kind of nice, since I graduated with a lot of people that I have known for my entire educational career up to that point. As also stated, my senior year of high school was quite a big one for me. From creating a self made technology class, creating the news team, and started the precedence of being able to bring laptops to our school for taking notes and using in class, it was a good time. This helped to push my career into technology to the next level. </p>

<p>After that, I started by time here at TAMUK in Fall of 2014 and actually started as a Computer Science major. After starting said major, I realized very quickly that it wasn't for me and after doing some time looking around and researching, I knew that it was Information Systems and IT work was really along the lines of what I wanted. So I transferred over and began my current major in Spring 2015. Due to my dual credit classes that I had taken during my high school days, a lot of my basic classes were already completed so I was doing a lot more of the advanced classes (sophomore and junior level classes) earlier than I was supposed to because I really didn't have much to do otherwise. Throughout my career here, I've been able to maintain top-notch grades (according to my standards), achieving a 3.95 GPA. I hope to maintain that GPA and begin to find the job for me. </p>
