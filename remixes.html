<p> The little videos that I make are what I like to call video remixes/covers. They are usually under a much more juvenile name, so I like to refer them as experimental edits. What I do is take or find a song that I would like to cover, and then using both video editing and DAW software, I take samples from various films and television shows and pitch them together to the music perfectly. 
I was able to self-teach myself the ins and outs of making these from scratch since 2011. Over the years, I've bettered myself and have been able to make some interesting content. Here's some examples of videos I've made above.</p>
<p>By making these types of videos, I also was able to learn the ins and outs of audio production and sound design, as I've taken my years to hone my audio skills and be able to not only make a sample sound better than it should, but sometimes morph existing samples into something you thought came from an actual drum machine or synthesizer. </p>
<p> Here is also a quick example of what I can do in terms of audio form as well. (The first few seconds is the sound of the raw sample before any editing, then what you hear after that is what I can produce audio wise. This audio was made back in 2017, and I have improved even more since then.) </p>

<h4 style = "text-align: center"> These videos have taught me a lot when it comes to how to create and edit content, along with doing motion graphics and animation for my edits as well. I also was able to learn and understand a lot of concepts around sound design, audio editing, mixing and mastering more than all my years of schooling taught me; and I've found some amazing new tunes thanks to this small hobby. </h4>
