<h1 style = "text-align: center"> Hobbies </h1>
<p> In terms of hobbies, I have quite a bit under my repertoire when it comes to spending my time away from work. For the most part I'm a big fan of video games, YouTube videos, and Film/Music. I'm a huge fan of the entertainment industry as a whole, so film and music are a big part of my life along with playing some video games with my friends. Because of my love for both film and music, I actually created some videos and music of my own. Check out below to see some examples and descriptions of everything! </p>

<section id="videos">
<h2 style = "text-align: center"> Video Editing/Remixes </h2>
<p> Over the past 6 years, I've been partaking in a niche little community that deals with editing and creating videos out of things such as films, tv shows, other YouTube videos, etc. At first, I started out as a general remixer; trying my best to make things what some would consider "trippy". However, as of 2013, I moved over into another subsection of said community that does the same thing, but edits it all to music and creates visuals for said remixes. In short, we watch various pieces of media, find some sort of vocal or percussive sound that could match the instrument used in the song, and then pitch them to the song itself. After doing this, we will put some visuals to the work to make it much more visually interesting to watch or just to showcase what the sample playing actually is. Since 2011, I have been learning and teaching myself how to use various video and audio editors to make these kinds of videos which has taught me quite a bit about multimedia as a whole. Doing this has not only been such an experience and something that I still love to do, but has helped me a lot in terms of learning about computers, video editing and videography, music creation, editing, music theory, and many more. I've also learned some life skills from these videos such as project management from hosting collaborations with upwards of 30+ people, and even more. </p>

<section id="audio">
<h2 style = "text-align: center"> Audio/Music and Sound Design </h2>

<p> Starting around 2015 or so, I started to try creating my own music. Branching  off from what I've learned, it has helped me a lot with learning not only how music works and how to create music. </p>
<p> I don't really have a lot to show for it <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/viravax"> as of late </a>, but I'm still slowly working on it; trying to learn and create music. However, I linked my soundcloud in here as you can see some originals I've made, including some that was for a game that came out this past year! </p> 
<p> While also creating music, I've also found a newfound love for music in general as well. I'm consistently looking around for new records and albums that will peak my interest. My music genre taste has grown exponentially over the past few years in college, and it's opened my eyes to some eye-catching albums and music that in terms also inspires me to keep being creative and explore what I truly love in life.</p>
<br>
<p>While also working on these videos above that I mention and you can read more about <a href = "remixes.html"> here (wink wink) </a>, I've been able to really broaden my horizons as well in the audio world with learning how to properly mix/master song tracks as well as for video essays. While I haven't done much for others yet, I've been able to do a lot of practice for it in the form of business projects that I had to do throughout college which has also helped me learn sound design in various ways with leveling out music and voiceovers, removing and deverbing sounds, etc. </p>
<p> I'll have a portfolio listed <a href = "portfolio.html"> Here.. </a> for you to check out if you are so inclined. There will be a text version and video version! </p>

<section id="film">
<h2 style = "text-align: center"> Film </h2>
<p> Right around the time I finished up high school, I took up an interest  in cinema and film as a whole. I can't say I remember what started the initial love of film for me, but I do know that the fascination and adoration for film grew more and more through my college life. Throughout my years, I began collecting tons of films (particularly Blu-Rays and started watching more and more films, no matter where the film came from, how old it was, etc.). </p>

<h3 style = "text-align: center"> Just to showcase.. here are my top 20 favorite films </h3>

<h2 style = "text-align: center"> Beta Testing </h2>
<p> Just recently at the start of this year, I started to become very interested in the idea of doing beta testing/QA for upcoming games and help them to define bugs and play through the story to make sure everything works and is looking good. It's been a fun journey so far, and while some I cannot annouce due to NDA, here are some games that I have tested! </p>
<ol>
<li> <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/844590/Hypnospace_Outlaw/"> Hypnospace Outlaw by Jay Tholen and published by No More Robots </a> </li>
<li> <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/597760/Yuppie_Psycho/"> Yuppie Psycho by Baroque Decay and published by Another Indie </a> </li>
<li> <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/app/761010/Wave_Break/"> Wave Break by Funktronic Labs </a> </li>
</ol>
<br>
<p> Hoping to add to this list more and more as time moves on, as it really is fun to play through the games ahead of time and look out for bugs and help make sure games I'm interested in is the best it can be. </p>
