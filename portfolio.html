<h1 style = "text-align: center"> My portfolio! </h1>
<h3 style = "text-align: center"> So, I wanted to have a central place to host my portfolio video/projects I've been a part of, so here's a page dedicated to that. </h3>

<br>
<br>

<h2 style = "text-align:center"> Portfolio </h2>

<h3 style = "text-align: center"> Collaborations </h3>
<h2 style = "text-align: center"> What are collaborations? </h2>
<p> In the sense that I am bringing up with the community I am a part of, a collaboration is whenever usually a host or co-hosts will gather up participants and select individual parts to make for a full song or custom made medley. These projects can span from being done in the short time of a month to some taking over a year! I have participated in many of these projects (well over 50 at this point) and have also hosted/co-hosted several collabs that have become majorly successfully in the community's terms of success. <p>
<br>
<h2 style = "text-align: center"> I'd like to share some of them with you now. </h2>
